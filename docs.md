# Smart contracts documentation for CRAT blockchain validators & delegators system

This repo contains following contracts:
1. CratStakeManager.sol - stake manager contract for validators and delegators accounting;
2. CratVesting.sol - vesting contract for sheduled unlocking funds for several system wallets.

## CRATStakeManager contract description
The contract is a system for accounting the list of active/inactive validators and their delegators. This staking contract has two reward mechanisms: APR, according to staked amount share.

### Variables

`bytes32 public constant DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE = keccak256("DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE");` - a constant to keep distributor role's value.

`bytes32 public constant SWAP_ROLE = keccak256("SWAP_ROLE");` - a constant to keep swap contract role's value.

`uint256 public constant PRECISION = 100_00;` - a constant to keep a denominator value for percents (2 decimal places; an example: 2% == 200).

`uint256 public constant YEAR_DURATION = 365 days;` - a constant to keep a year duration in seconds.

`GeneralSettings public settings;` - general settings of the contract in GeneralSettings struct format (see below in Structs section).

`uint256 public totalValidatorsPool;` - total sum of staked CRAT coins by active validators.

`uint256 public totalDelegatorsPool;` - total sum of staked CRAT coins by active delegators.

`uint256 public stoppedValidatorsPool;` - total sum of staked CRAT coins by stopped validators.

`uint256 public stoppedDelegatorsPool;` - total sum of staked CRAT coins by stopped delegators.

`uint256 public forFixedReward;` - sum of CRAT coins on the contract available for APR% payments (increases when receive is triggered, decreases when the reward is withdrawn).
